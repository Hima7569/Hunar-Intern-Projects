Email Spam Detection Project
This project involves building an email spam detection system using machine learning techniques. The steps followed in this project are outlined below:

Steps to Follow
1. Import Libraries and Dataset
Import Libraries: Import necessary libraries such as pandas for data manipulation.
Import Dataset: Load the dataset provided in the task file.
2. Data Preprocessing
Remove Null Values: Clean the dataset by removing any null values to ensure data integrity.
Remove Duplicates: Eliminate duplicate entries from the dataset to avoid redundancy.
Split Dataset: Divide the dataset into training and testing subsets to evaluate the model's performance.
3. Implement Model
Linear Regression Model: Apply a linear regression model to the training dataset.
Check Accuracy: Evaluate the model's performance on the training data to check its accuracy.
4. Model Evaluation
Test Model: Use the testing dataset to evaluate the model.
Accuracy Check: Ensure the model is predicting accurate values by comparing its output with the actual values in the testing dataset.
5. Testing
Test with Different Datasets: Evaluate the model with different datasets to ensure its robustness and accuracy across various data samples.
